## My process
First, I wrote the HTML code for the structure of the project. I decided to use a container as main structure and 3 smaller containers for 
each column inside the parent container. 
Each column contains its own h1, p, img and cta elements. I used classes and ids to call on them later on CSS. 
Every paragrapch on each column is wrapped in a div container to allow me to give the same margin around the text regardless of the 
paragraphs' lengths. 

For CSS, I followed the Mobile-first design best practices and styled the tablet and desktop version later on using Media queries. I used Flexbox to give structure to all my div containers. The flex wrap property adds responsiveness based on the width of the browser. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
During this project I got a better understanding of how Flexbox works and how to apply to my projects. Since I needed to make it responsive, reading and watching tutorials on just Flexbox helped me write a more clear and simplified code. 

### Continued development

For my future projects I want to continue focusing on Flexbox technology and Grid in CSS as well, since I would like to refine my skills in responsive design and be able to fix minor issues I still have with layout in CSS.
